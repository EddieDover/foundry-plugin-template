# Foundry Plugin Template

This is a foundry plugin template that I use. I assume absolutely no responsibility for anything that goes wrong if you decide to use it yourself.

Look for instances of `your-module-name`, `YourName`, `Your@Email.com`, etc and replace them.

Remember to `npm install` and change the value in `foundryconfig.json` before using `npm run link-project`, so you can test your module properly.

I've added `npm run devexport` to generate zipped builds for my beta-testers. It should work on any system but since it makes changes to the filesystem (creating/deleting a folder) use at your own risk.
